Hello, this repository is used to describe the functionality of our commom modules.
If you have questions or/and suggestions or wanna participate in the module development?!
Feel free to collaborate!

Why?

We are introducing these modules from a none technical view, they are our "toolset" of 
daily requiered datasets that need to be flexible pluggable. They are especially designed under
an economic (EUROPEAN POINT OF) view.
